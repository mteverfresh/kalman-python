# kalman-python
A simple kalman filter in python.

## Description
Just as its name suggests, this is a simple Python implementation of a Kalman filter, implemented for UML's EECE7120 Special Topics in Multi-Sensor Data Fusion class. The filter will start as a simple, single-parameter example and will evolve into a matrix-driven multidimensional example as the project continues.
